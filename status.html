    <h1>Status Checker Information</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the bot.html page. If you've arrived here, you've likely
      noticed our status checker accessing your website.

      <br />
      <br />

      The only automated tool we use is <code>GoExportStatusChecker/1.0</code>,
      which simply verifies if your website is online.

      <br />
      <br />

      This tool does not collect any data; it works as a companion to our main
      software, <a href="https://goexport.lexian.dev/">GoExport.</a>
      <br />
      <br />

      If you see this status checker in your server logs, it means a GoExport
      user has started the app, selected your website, and is exporting their
      video.
